### Cover Letter


I am writing to you to express my interest in interviewing for the position of Dashboard/Visualization Developer in R. With my degree in Statistics and Mathematics, and years of experience as a Data Analyst/Business Analytics/Data Scientist under my belt, I think I can be a great asset to your organization.

My professional experience includes data management, data wrangling, crafting algorithms, building bespoke visualizations, and making use of machine learning to mine and make sense of data and then using data visualization to present said data to decision-makers. Couple this experience with my passion for data and I think I’d be an excellent fit at your organization.
The following are my most relevant qualifications and accomplishments:

Crafted algorithms using R to filter data collection results

Implemented data mining strategies to build a database of meaningful data

Developed automated anomaly detector to increase efficiency and accuracy

Created data visualization graphs and charts to make meaning of data for data value chain stakeholders

Developed and followed the standard operating procedure for verifying data integrity

What separates me from other candidates with similar qualifications are my written and verbal communication skills. I love talking about data and thrive on explaining the meaning of data to non-technical stakeholders. If you think I’d be a good fit for your organization, then I’d be thrilled to set up an interview.

<!-- A result-driven data practitioner with an excellent understanding of all aspects of data analytics and statistics.
